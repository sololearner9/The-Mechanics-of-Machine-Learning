This book is a primer on machine learning for programmers trying to get up to speed quickly. You'll learn how machine learning works and how to apply it in practice. We focus on just a few powerful models (algorithms) that are extremely effective on real problems, rather than presenting a broad survey of machine learning algorithms as many books do. Co-author Jeremy used these few models to become the #1 competitor for two consecutive years at Kaggle.com. This narrow approach leaves lots of room to cover the models, training, and testing in detail, with intuitive descriptions and full code implementations.  This is a book in progress and we will add chapters and make edits
